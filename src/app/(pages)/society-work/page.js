    content: `I have been part of a crowdfunding campaign where the goal was to
      raise Rs 15000, for an underprivileged girl. I managed to raise Rs
      31000 for that girl and this money was able to cover her education
      expenses, her food and her uniform expenses. Nothing made me happier
      than seeing the look of joy in her eyes.`

      school hours for underprivileged students. I volunteered to teach
      them basic maths and Science at least 2-3 times as well as donated

    content: `In the 4th Semester of my college, I took an elective named
      "Extension and Outreach", where I worked on raising awareness about
      menstrual hygiene among poor women and girls. I visited a few NGOs
      and talked about the importance of menstrual hygiene, made posters
      and conducted a few activities so that the women and girls could
      interact. I talked about the myths and taboos of menstruation, the
      importance of sanitary napkins, the importance of hygiene and many
      more.(Received O grade in this, highest)`

    content: `Currently, I am also a mentor of a 'Girls Grow Program'. In this program, 
      our main focus is on secondary and senior school girls. Our main aim is to 
      motivate these girls in the field of STEM. Girls are discouraged from pursuing 
      STEM, or they don't have the right/adequate guidance to form the required decision. 
      So we conduct sessions for these girls about various topics like what STEM is, 
      what options they have in STEM, the resources for the STEM fields, women in STEM, 
      colleges, Career options in STEM field and much more.`
